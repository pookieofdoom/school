Q: “How is this LWP library different from a real thread management library?
    Name two ways in which this LWP library API could be improved.”
    
A: This LWP library can't run two proceses at the same time and any synchronization
    aspects such as Test, Set, and Lock.
   
   A way to improve the LWP library is to make them premptive from non-premptive. 
    Premptive is generally better since they are more efficient depending on hardware.
   
   Another improvement is to add ways to pass messages or data between the threads which
    thread libraries should be able to do. This will improve the quality of our LWP library.
    This can probably be done using pipes or sockets.
