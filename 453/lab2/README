Questions:
1. For what types of workloads does SRJN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?

	The only way for SRJN to deliver the same turnaround time as FIFO is that everything arrives
	at the same time and that the it is already in order of shortest job first. This will display
	the same turn around time.
	
2. For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRJN deliver the same response times as RR?
	
	If quantum lengths is large enough, then RR is esentially FIFO which then if everything
	arrives at the same time in order of shortest job first, then we can ensure the same response
	time.
	
	
3. What happens to response time with SRJN as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?

	Respone time will increase as job lengths increase since their arrivial time remains constant,
	but their burst time increases, then it will take longer for next shortest job to start when it is
	waiting for a smaller job to finish.
	Using my simulator, if I run 4 jobs at certain burst time and arrival, and then increase
	the burst time of all by +10, then the average response time increases by +10. If I only increase
	one job's length out of the list, the average also increases.
	
4. What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?

	Response time increases as the quantum lengths increase. Eventually the response time is capped which the equation for this can
	be determined, given N jobs,
	
	(N-1)*q = worse case scenerio waiting time
	when q = N *2 == worse case scenrio for response time
