Program 3
To execute : ./memSim.py <address-text> <frames> <PRA>

The order of parameters matter and can only omit both <frames> and <pra> 
together or omit just <pra>. You cannot omit <frames> but still try to use
<pra>. The default values used when omited are 256 = frames and FIFO = pra 

The files that are needed for the execution:
memSim.py, Storage.py, constants.py, BACKING_STORE.bin, and any input file
that contains the addresses to translate
