Notes:
1. Even though Professor Smith said malloc was not needed, I had to malloc for
my structs because after TCP struct i would eventually seg fault and the fix
for it was to use malloc.

2. It seems like my program has trouble with pcap files that have huge packet sizes
but it should pass all the test cases and I have chosen pcap files that are similar
in size to that of largeMix1 and largeMix2
