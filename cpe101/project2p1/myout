*** Testing showWelcome... ***


Welcome aboard the Lunar Module Flight Simulator

   To begin you must specify the LM's initial altitude
   and fuel level.  To simulate the actual LM use
   values of 1300 meters and 500 liters, respectively.

   Good luck and may the force be with you!


*** Testing getFuel... ***

TEST 1: When prompted, input a number greater than 0.  You should not see an error.

Enter the initial amount of fuel on board the LM (in liters): 
Fuel returned was: 5

TEST 2: When prompted, input 0.  You should see and error and then be prompted again.
Then enter a negative number.  You should see the same error message and be 
prompted again.  Finally, enter a number greater than 0.

Enter the initial amount of fuel on board the LM (in liters): ERROR: Amount of fuel must be positive, please try again
Enter the initial amount of fuel on board the LM (in liters): ERROR: Amount of fuel must be positive, please try again
Enter the initial amount of fuel on board the LM (in liters): 
Fuel returned was: 5

*** Testing getAltitude... ***

TEST 1: When prompted, input a number greater than 0 and less than 10,000. You should not see an error.

Enter the initial altitude of the LM (in meters): 
Altitude returned was: 100

TEST 2: When prompted, input 0. You should see and error and then be prompted again.
Then enter a negative number. You should see the same error message and be 
prompted again. Then, enter a number greater than 10,000. You should see the same error.
Finally, enter a number greater than 0 and less than 10,000.

Enter the initial altitude of the LM (in meters): ERROR: Altitude must be between 1 and 9999, inclusive, please try again
Enter the initial altitude of the LM (in meters): ERROR: Altitude must be between 1 and 9999, inclusive, please try again
Enter the initial altitude of the LM (in meters): ERROR: Altitude must be between 1 and 9999, inclusive, please try again
Enter the initial altitude of the LM (in meters): 
Altitude returned was: 5
